\section{Introduction}

Taxicoin is an attempt at designing and building a user-facing application for hailing taxis, where the entire system is fully decentralised, with no central authority in control. The motivation behind this is to combat some of the issues found with existing similar traditional applications, such as \textit{Uber} and \textit{Lyft}.

These companies saw a way to improve the taxi industry, and by improving the user experience and ease of ordering a taxi, attracted many users. However, as was the case with existing taxi companies, they still take a significant cut of fares. Coupled with the fact that they attempt to keep fares lower for passengers, the drivers are left with very little earnings.
