# Taxicoin

Taxicoin is a decentralised ride-sharing app, which uses Ethereum to manage all the logistics. The aim of the project is to provide a more open alternative to existing applications, and one without any intermediary to take a cut of drivers' profits.

It is the final year project of Scott Street, a Computer Science undergraduate at Aston University, Birmingham. As such, please do not attempt to contribute!
